# About us

In the **Runemark lab** at **Lund University** we are interested in identifying how variation arises and the processes by which it sorts into new species, as well as which ecological settings and factors promote these processes. **Genomics** is a main tool in our research. 

In this organization we gather useful pipelines, workflows and scripts that talented students have contributed while working in the Runemark lab. The resources span **variant calling workflows** and **population genomics**, **analysis of gene expression**, **genetic analysis of museum samples**, **de novo assembly** and **genome annotation**.

## Research Projects

We currently have four main research projects:

- The **ERC funded project HybridExpress** focusing on how **hybridization** can result in **novel variation** where we use independent lineages of hybrid Italian sparrows on Mediterranean islands as a study system. 
- In the second project we attempt at disentangling the **genomic basis of speciation** using a host plant shift in *Tephritis* flies as a model, specifically focusing on the roles of **coding genetic differences** and **gene expression**. 
- We also have a project where we address how we can inform **conservation of evolutionary potential** in species in anthropogenically altered landscapes using genomic tools, with specific focus on **loss of genetic diversity** over time. 
- Finally, we are interested in the **genomic basis of complex floral traits**, including in the role of **polyploidy**. This project is run in close collaboration with Magne Friberg.
